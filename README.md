Hello, 

I hope you are well, in this project I have created a betting slot machine:

-	The user will have to deposit some money 
-	The user will have to spin the slot machine by betting on a certain number of lines
-	The slot machine has reels that contains different symbols
-	We have 3 reels, each reel has 3 symbols, the slot machine will have 3 lines, whenever you play a slot machine there is a certain number of lines you can win on
-	In this project we will created 3 lines to win on, you can only win if you get 3 of the same symbols in one row
-	Each symbol will have a varying multiplayer, if the user bets £1 on a line and the symbol had a multiplier of 5 this means the user would have won £5
-	The user is allowed to bet on a certain number of lines, if the user bets on 1 row, they have to get matching symbol on the first row, if they bet on 2 rows they need to get matching symbols on the first 2 rows and if they bet on all 3 lines they can get matching symbols on any row
-	Whatever bet amount they make will be multiplied by the number of lines that they bet on 
-	E.g if they bet £1 on 3 lines, then they will be betting £3 in total, if they get a matching symbol in any of the rows, then they can win a certain amount of money based on what the multiplier is for that symbol.

Thank you very much for taking the time to view my project.

Kind Regards
